üèóÔ∏è system-design-in-code
A practical repository for learning and demonstrating System Design concepts through Production-Ready Java Code.

This project bridges the gap between theoretical system design concepts (like distributed transactions, load balancing, and microservices) and their concrete, runnable implementations using modern Java frameworks and tools.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a reference implementation for common system design problems, allowing developers to:

See how system design concepts are translated into code.

Practice building scalable, robust, and performant backend systems.

Understand the trade-offs of various architectural choices (e.g., monolith vs. microservices, synchronous vs. asynchronous communication).
