# system-design-in-code
A practical repository for learning and demonstrating System Design concepts through Production-Ready Java Code.  This project bridges the gap between theoretical system design concepts (like distributed transactions, load balancing, and microservices) and their concrete, runnable implementations using modern Java frameworks and tools.
